339,is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?,i've got to go.
340,i wasn't done talking to you.,"i have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey."
341,i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.,i really don't think it's any of your business.
342,that's not nice.,"i apologize, but i'm getting off the phone now."
343,okay.,what's the rush?

345,there are other things i need to take care of.,what is it that you need to do? 
346,please don't be nosey.,"i'm not being nosey, it's just a question."

373,"yes, it is. but it still looks good.",do you take good care of it?
374,"oh, yes. i wash it once a week.",do you change the oil?
375,my mechanic changes the oil twice a year.,"no, i don't. do you?"
376,"i don't have a girlfriend, either.",why not?
377,i don't know. maybe i'm not rich enough.,girls like guys with money.
378,they sure do.,they like guys with new cars.
379,i don't have money or a new car.,"me, neither."
380,but girls like guys who are funny.,maybe we should learn some good jokes.
381,i have to walk the dog.,what kind of dog do you have?
382,i have a little poodle.,poodles bark a lot.
383,they sure do.,they bark at everything.
384,they never shut up.,why did you get a poodle?
385,it's my mom's dog.,so she likes poodles.
386,she says they're good watchdogs.,sure. why do you need it?
387,i want to buy lunch.,where's your money?
388,it's not in my wallet.,your wallet is empty?
389,i don't have even one dollar in it.,being broke is no fun.
390,even if it's only for a short while.,it's always good to have friends.
391,friends will lend you money when you're broke.,as long as you pay them back.
392,that's a great idea.,we haven't been in a while.
393,we haven't been in a month.,"the last time we went, you almost drowned."
394,"no, i didn't.",then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
395,i think he wanted to cool off.,he swam right up to you.
396,and then he turned right around.,maybe you're right.

398,when did you get divorced?,i got divorced two years ago.
399,why did you get divorced?,my wife left me.

407,i love that show.,i watched it once. that was enough.
408,it's on right now. let's watch it together.,i agree. pasadena is a nice city.
409,it's not too big.,and it's not too small.
410,it has great weather all year long.,it has the rose parade.
411,it has beautiful houses.,it has wonderful restaurants.
412,it has great schools.,it's close to the mountains.
413,the people are friendly.,i'm not ever going to leave.
414,what's the matter with this one?,it's not comfortable.
415,it seems fine to me.,i toss and turn all night.
416,you should stop drinking coffee.,look at these marks on my arms.
417,what are they?,they are bites.

421,that's a good question.,did you take it to a computer shop?
422,i would if i had the money.,"well, i guess you have to live with it."
423,sometimes i want to throw it out the window.,you don't want to do that.
424,why not?,you might hit someone in the head.
425,i'm not sure.,how about a pizza?
426,you had pizza for lunch.,but i love pizza.
427,everybody loves pizza.,so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
428,because you need variety.,"what's ""variety?"
429,different thingsÃ‚â€”not the same thing all the time.,"you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?"
430,"no, i mean a salad instead of a pizza.",why do we need to save money?
431,because we need to buy a house.,but a house is so expensive.
432,that's why we need to save money.,how much do we need to save?
433,we need to save enough for a down payment.,how much is that?
434,"that's about $30,000.",thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
435,not if we save every penny.,okay. here's seven pennies.
436,you can't see the end of it.,it goes on and on forever.
437,"and it's deep, too.",i think it's five miles deep.
438,are there fish at the bottom?,there are fish at the top and the bottom.
439,are there more fish or more people?,i think there are more fish.
440,i hope so. i love to eat fish.,why is that?
441,i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me.,what happened?
442,"i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself.",that was very nice of you.
443,i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.,why did she do that?
444,he said he would buy her a nice ring.,what's wrong with that?
445,he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.,i hope your mom broke up with him.
446,of course they talk to each other.,what do they talk about?
447,they talk about other animals.,what else do they talk about?
448,they talk about food and the weather.,do they talk about us?
449,of course they talk about us.,what do they say about us?
450,they say that we are funny-looking.,ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
451,we're funny-looking because we wear clothes.,"yes, it's very dirty."
452,you can help me.,why me?
453,because you helped make it dirty.,what do you want me to do?
454,i want you to clean the bathroom.,"oh, that's easy."
455,"clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.",that's a lot of work.
456,tell me when you finish.,i don't think so. you'll just give me more work.
457,what do you mean?,i mean you're wasting your life.
458,i'm having fun.,you're sitting there with your mouth open.
459,who cares?,i care. do something.
460,okay. i did something.,what did you do?
461,i turned up the volume.,"that's not what i meant by ""do something."""
462,will you do something? leave me alone.,"yes, i did."

464,did you put the letter in an envelope?,"yes, and i sealed the envelope."

466,they're in the kitchen drawer.,okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.
467,"give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you.",when is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
468,i'm sleepy.,why don't you go to bed?
469,i want to watch this tv show.,maybe you should record it.
470,the tape recorder is broken.,then you should watch the rerun.
471,why? i'm watching the original.,but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
472,i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.,okay. i'll tell you how the show ends.
473,zzz.,so?
474,you know what that means.,i forgot.
475,sunday means we go to church.,"oh, yeah."
476,put on a coat and tie.,why?
477,to show respect to god and others.,i'm glad sunday is only once a week.
478,i hope god didn't hear that.,he'll forgive me.
479,i'll do that in a minute.,the cat is meowing. he's hungry.
480,okay. i'll feed him right now.,you shouldn't make him wait.
481,i was doing my homework.,the cat doesn't care about your homework.
482,the cat doesn't care about anything.,that's the way cats are.
483,all they think about is themselves.,maybe we should get rid of him.
484,of course not! he's family.,me too.
485,i just cut myself again.,did you use a new blade?
486,"it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut.",maybe you should use an electric shaver.
487,"they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.",maybe you should stop shaving.
488,and grow a beard?,sure. why not?
489,because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.,hmm. here's an idea. put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
490,yes?,are you reading this paper?
491,"oh, no. help yourself.",i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
492,thank you. that's polite of you to ask.,some people would just pick it up.
493,"yes, i know. some people are rude.",i always try to be polite.
494,so do i.,the world needs more polite people like us.
495,i agree 100 percent.,let me think about it.
496,why do you have to think about it?,because a puppy costs money.
497,"no, it doesn't. puppies are free.","yes, but a puppy needs shots."
498,shots for what?,so it won't get sick. just like you get shots.
499,i hate shots.,and a puppy eats food. food costs money.
500,no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.,"oh, no you don't. puppies don't eat vegetables."
501,how many are there?,eight.
502,they're all so cute.,"yes, but i can't keep them."
503,what are you going to do with them?,i'm going to give them away. do you want one?
504,"yes, i would love one.",which one do you want?
505,that one. the one that's all black.,"yes, i like that one, too."
506,i'll call him blacky.,they trust in god.
507,they hope they will go to heaven.,they probably will.
508,but no one knows for sure.,that's for sure.
509,no one knows what happens after we die.,"if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god."
510,that's what many people believe.,"if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell."
511,i don't want to go to hell.,let's go to church with your parents on sunday.
512,i'm sorry for you.,thank you.
513,when did he die?,a couple of months ago.
514,you still miss him.,"yes, but i talk to him almost every day."
515,when you go to church?,"no, when i call him on his cell phone."
516,what do you mean?,i buried him with his cell phone.
517,what will you do when the battery dies?,that's a bad day.
518,it's supposed to be unlucky.,you're supposed to stay home all day.

520,that was a mistake.,he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
521,what happened?,someone stole his laptop.
522,he was asking for it.,he learned his lesson. he's home today.
523,of course.,prove it.
524,how can i prove it?,take me to dinner.
525,that's it? that's all i have to do?,"take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's."
526,but a nice restaurant costs money.,"yes, and you have to make a reservation."
527,that's such a hassle.,i knew you didn't love me.
528,"okay, okay! i'll make a reservation right now.",so are mine.
529,why did your parents get divorced?,my father found a new girlfriend.
530,that's too bad.,my mother was hurt and angry.
531,she had good reason. what did she do?,she told him to drop his girlfriend.
532,what did your father do?,he moved out of our house.
533,i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.,"yes, but she left him a year later."
534,so does mine.,i think it's an old people's smell.
535,really?,"yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell."
536,like fruit that is too ripe?,"yes, just like fruit that is too ripe."
537,but the smell is different.,"yes, old people don't smell like fruit."
538,"no, they smell like a thrift shop.","yes, a thrift shop has that same smell."
539,"yes, an old smell.",i think stamps used to cost a penny.
540,that was a long time ago.,it was before i was born.
541,now a stamp is 42 cents.,but in may it will be 44 cents.
542,have you ever lost a letter in the mail?,"no, i haven't."
543,neither have i.,"so, they do a good job for the money."
544,"yes, they do.",maybe we shouldn't complain.
545,what are you going to do?,"first, i have to find the button."
546,where did you lose it?,i have no idea.
547,a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?,that's a good idea.
548,i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.,"let me look. no, it's not there."
549,many shirts come with an extra button.,you're right. this one does have an extra button.
550,now all you have to do is sew it on.,you drink too much coffee.
551,but i love coffee.,"well, it's your life."
552,you eat too much chocolate.,i don't think so.

564,what do they say?,they say they want change.
565,what kind of change?,they want tax cuts.

572,"no, thank you. all you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.",i don't know. look in the fridge.
573,i think i'll make a sandwich.,what kind?
574,a ham sandwich.,the bread is in the cabinet.
575,where's the mustard?,"it's in the fridge, i think."
576,"oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?","yes, that sounds nice."
577,how about some potato chips?,"yes. and a pickle, if we have any."
578,"but, mom, i'm not dirty.",you need a bath every day.
579,why?,because you don't want to smell bad.
580,i don't smell bad.,that's what you think.
581,"if i smelled bad, i could smell me.",i can smell you.
582,"i can smell you, too.",that's my perfume.
583,when can i wear perfume?,exactly what?
584,all i get is a black screen.,what's the matter?
585,"i think i know, because this happened before.",what happened before?

590,that's too bad. how much is a new one?,"it's not too much, only about $85."
591,plus installation?,"no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace."
592,really?,"yes, it's just a couple of screws."
593,that's nice.,it's a lot better than paying someone $60.
594,"if my hard drive crashes, i'll just call you.",it's bluedog123.
595,bluedog123. are you sure that's all?,yes.
596,no. that's incomplete.,what do you mean?
597,what's your mailing address?,"456 cherry drive, pasadena, ca 91170."
598,that's correct.,so what's the problem?
599,"bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and zip code.","oh, i get it. my email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com."
600,you should unplug the phone.,that's a good idea.
601,do you want me to wake you in an hour?,"no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up."
602,i'll start dinner at 6:00.,okay. i think i'll be awake by then.
603,"if not, your nose will wake you up.",you mean i will smell the food cooking?
604,you might even dream about dinner.,i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
605,have a nice nap.,"yes, dad, it was."
606,the son gave a nice speech about his father.,"it was long, too."
607,i think it was about 45 minutes long.,but it went by fast. it was interesting.
608,i liked it.,"i'll give you a speech like that, too."
609,do you think anyone will come to my funeral?,of course.
610,i think only the family will be there.,"you have lots of friends. they will be there, too!"
611,i had to blow my nose.,did you have to blow right next to the phone?
612,did you hear that?,of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
613,it wasn't that loud.,"i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see."

620,i feel sorry for you.,i have only a few friends.
621,you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you.,that's very nice of you.

624,i'm an open book. watch me all you want.,"if i catch you, you'll be sorry."
625,"you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater.",i will poke your eyes out. 
626,i don't want any other woman.,"i will chop your toes off, one by one."
627,"honey, please. you're the only woman for me, forever. i swear it.",me too.

629,i agree.,this city is full of jerks.
630,rude people are everywhere.,but what can you do?
631,you can yell at them.,and they will yell back at you.
632,yelling doesn't do any good.,no. the best thing to do is just stay home.
633,are you having problems with it?,i don't understand some things.
634,let me help you.,"what does ""mi"" mean?"
635,"""mi"" stands for middle initial.","what does ""mm/dd/yy"" mean?"
636,that means month/day/year. use numbers.,i don't understand.

644,i don't know. i just woke up.,why don't you look outside?
645,okay. it looks like rain.,why do you say that?
646,the sky is gray.,is it raining right now?

664,i just insert my debit card into the machine.,and it gives you money?
665,"well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.",oh. what good is that? i thought it gave you free money.

667,what time does the recycle truck come by?,"it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow."
668,i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.,"oh, no, you don't."
669,what do you mean?,every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
670,do you think i'll forget to do it?,"you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it."
671,"okay, i'll take it out front right now.",ready for what?
672,ready for the big switch.,what are you talking about?
673,the nation is switching to digital tv.,oh. of course i'm ready.
674,did you buy the converter?,"no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv."
675,how much was that?,it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
676,does it pick up any digital channels?,"oh, yes. i get six korean channels but nothing in english!"
677,they sure are.,did you hear about the pilot?
678,the one that stole a small plane?,"yes, he stole a plane in canada and flew into the u.s."
679,did they catch him?,"yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway."
680,did he crash?,"no, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant."
681,did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?,his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
682,poor guy.,how do you know?
683,the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.,do they know what the robber looks like?
684,"yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.",what race is he?
685,they didn't say.,the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
686,of course not. that would be racist.,but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
687,don't ask me.,"then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist."
688,but i don't have a tissue.,then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
689,i didn't have time to get one from there.,your sleeves are not tissues.
690,"but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.",that doesn't make it right.
691,i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.,i will talk to your father about that.
692,i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.,your daddy was a good little boy.
693,"how do you know? were you his mommy, too?",worried about what?
694,i'm getting married.,"you should be happy, not worried."
695,"i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.","yes, you have to take care of your wife."
696,and i have to take care of our children.,are you going to start a family?
697,yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.,that sounds wonderful.
698,except we can't afford it!,no wonder you're worried.
699,or artists.,they're in a different world.
700,i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.,the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
701,but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?,artists see things differently.
702,did you ever see anything that picasso painted?,of course! he's world famous.
703,did he ever take art lessons?,i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
704,where are they? maybe they are worth millions.,the point of what?
705,of living.,"who knows? you live, and then you die."
706,we must be here for some reason.,maybe we're here to have fun.
707,then why aren't i having fun?,because you're thinking too much.
708,so i should stop thinking?,stop thinking about what the point is.
709,okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.,just be patient. fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
710,so are cigarettes.,which would you prefer?
711,what do you mean?,"when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes."
712,i could pick only one or the other?,"yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven."
713,"boy, that's a tough one.","what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes."
714,but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.,"well, you can't have everything."
715,i don't think i want to go to your heaven.,you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
716,yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.,lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
717,who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?,"criminals, of course."
718,"anyway, i have to fix the hole.",you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
719,tell me about this patch.,the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
720,that sounds a lot easier than sewing.,"it is. but after about ten washings, the glue washes off."
721,i can't remember jokes.,neither can i.
722,they go in one ear and out the other.,who makes up all these jokes?
723,who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.,"yes, just in english alone."
724,i wonder if every language has jokes.,of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
725,what do you think people joke about the most?,i think most jokes are about women.
726,"oh, really? i think most jokes are about men!",why do you say that?
727,you speak two languages.,"well, my english isn't perfect."
728,no one speaks perfect english.,maybe i will be the first!
729,i've been thinking about learning spanish.,spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
730,how long will it take me to learn?,i think it will only take you a year or two.
731,how soon can we begin?,ahora! that means right now.
732,"yes, it's april 22.",it's more than just a date.
733,is it your birthday or anniversary?,"no, it's earth day."
734,what's that?,it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
735,"oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?","yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags."
736,how about if i take shorter showers?,"that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water."
737,from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.,i don't know anyone who likes it.
738,"some of it is okay, i guess.","yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember."
739,"like ""one, two, buckle my shoe.""",but people still write poems.
740,no one makes any money at it.,shakespeare was a poet.
741,did he get rich from his poetry?,probably not.
742,poems are a little bit like songs.,"yes, but songs have music. without music, songs would suck, too."
743,i don't know. i think i'm average.,did you ever take an iq test?
744,"no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.",i wish i was really smart.
745,don't be ridiculous.,what do you mean?
746,"if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.",don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
747,it must be very lonely.,why's that?
748,"because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.",nothing that would pass as news.
749,what's the weather going to be like this weekend?,"i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels."
750,what was the lead story on the news?,some actress was in court for driving without a license.
751,what was the second story?,some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
752,what was the third story?,a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
753,wasn't there anything about octo-mom?,of course. she's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
754,"well, mostly i'll try to avoid it.","i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?"
755,my wife and i will be cremated.,are you going to be buried next to each other?
756,"oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.",you're not going to be buried?
757,a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.,"yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you."
758,children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.,"that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people."
759,we figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.,"yes, of course i wiped my feet."
760,then why is there mud on the carpet?,i don't know. it's not my mud.
761,"well, someone brought it into the house.",look at the bottom of my shoesÃ‚â€”they're clean.
762,of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.,"okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner."
763,don't vacuum it now.,don't you want me to clean up the mud?
764,wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum.,next time i will be more careful.
765,what are you talking about?,sunday is mother's day.
766,this sunday?,of course. it's all over the news.
767,i thought it was next sunday.,"well, you'd better get her something."
768,i'll get her a nice card.,is that it?
769,yes. that's all i ever give her.,"she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?"
770,it's okay. she knows that i love her.,what's the matter with it?
771,it's too much like other flags.,"yes, a lot of flags have stripes."
772,a flag should be pretty.,what should our flag look like?
773,it should have a pretty woman on it.,that's ridiculous!
774,you don't like pretty women?,of course i do. but not on our flag!
775,every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.,you can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
776,what did you do?,i watered all the plants.
777,you have a lot of plants.,then i did my laundry.
778,that takes some time.,i took the dog for a walk.
779,i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.,i vacuumed the entire house.
780,that's a lot of work.,and then i made lunch.
781,i'll bet you were hungry!,so how do you make long distance calls?
782,i use a calling card.,where do you get that?
783,i buy it at the dollar store.,how much is it?
784,it's one dollar for 100 minutes.,that's only a penny a minute!
785,it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.,how many?
786,"first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.",yikes. i think i'll keep my long distance service.
787,"yes, i do.",what college do you go to?
788,i go to pasadena city college.,do you like it?
789,"oh, yes, i really like it.",why do you like it?
790,because it has great teachers.,what else?
791,"i like all my classmates, too.",anything else?
792,yes. it's not expensive!,where did you lose it?
793,i don't know.,when did you lose it?
794,i think i lost it today. i used it yesterday.,did you check all your pockets?
795,i checked all my pockets.,did you look in your desk?
796,"yes. it isn't there, either.",it's probably around somewhere.
797,"oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.",only a dollar? don't even look for it.
798,what is gravity?,it's the force that pulls everything down.
799,i don't understand.,"if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass."
800,of course it does.,"without gravity, the water would go up."
801,you're joking.,"without gravity, you would go up."
802,what do you mean?,you would float into the sky like a balloon.
803,that would be fun!,turn on the light.
804,the light is on.,open the book.
805,the book is open.,see an eye doctor.
806,that's what i need to do.,he'll give you a prescription for glasses.
807,i'll make an appointment tomorrow.,i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
808,read the phone number to me.,"i'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too."
809,i need pencils.,anything else?
810,i need a notebook.,do you need a pen?
811,no. i already have a pen.,do you need a calculator?
812,no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.,how about a dictionary?
813,"no, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.","well, i guess that's it."
814,"yes, that's all i need for now.",so do i.
815,"i read it once, and i subscribed.",it gives you all the news.
816,all the news in only 50 pages.,i like the political cartoons.
817,i like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.,i always read the film reviews.
818,i never miss the food and drink section.,i gave a subscription to my parents.
819,me too. they canceled their other news magazines.,so did mine!
820,shake it a couple of times.,i shook it. there is no more ink.
821,you can borrow mine.,thank you. i'll buy a new one tomorrow.
822,what were you doing?,i was writing a letter.
823,who were you writing to?,it's to my mom.
824,tell her i said hello.,okay. i'll return your pen when i'm done.
825,take your time.,not yet.
826,then why are you watching tv?,this is my favorite show.
827,go do your homework.,"but, mom!"
828,you can watch tv after you do your homework.,but the show will be over.
829,there will be another show next week.,please?
830,you know the rules.,i hate the rules! i can't wait till i grow up.
831,me too.,no more homework.
832,i hate homework.,are you going to college?
833,i can't afford it.,me neither.
834,so what are you going to do?,i'm joining the army.
835,you're kidding. you might get killed.,"i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college."
836,that's not a bad idea.,english.
837,what are you going to do with an english major?,i'm going to be a teacher.
838,high school or middle school?,high school.
839,i teach high school english.,i didn't know that.
840,i started teaching five years ago.,how do you like it?
841,do you see all this gray hair? it was totally black five years ago.,maybe i'll teach middle school.
842,i'll say.,i drove around for half an hour.
843,did you find a spot?,"i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me."
844,did you yell at them?,"yes, i did."
845,and?,and he yelled back at me.
846,how rude.,but i got lucky a few minutes later.
847,you have to be lucky to find a parking space.,"yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space."
848,and lots of books.,and lots of thieves.
849,what do you mean?,"i mean, keep your belongings close to you."
850,the only thing in my backpack is used books.,but thieves don't know that.
851,they might think that i've got an ipod or laptop in there.,now you're thinking.
852,you'd think a library would be safe from thieves.,not even a church is safe from thieves.
853,i can add two and two.,so you're not very good at math?
854,i'm terrible at math.,"well, i need some help."
855,with what?,i'm taking a math course in school.
856,"well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.",i can't do that.
857,why not?,they might think i'm stupid.
858,they're not going to think that! they'll be glad to help you.,of course.
859,do you pray to god?,occasionally.
860,when's that?,when i need something.
861,like what?,"well, if i have a big test at school."
862,does god answer your prayers?,"yes, i've passed all my tests."
863,do you ever pray for money?,not yet. i won't need to do that until i graduate from high school.
864,what husband?,the husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.
865,"oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.",the husband said he tried to help the boy.
866,"yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.","no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street."
867,so what? they still drove off.,the husband said a fire department was nearby.
868,so what? did he dial 911?,"he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it."
869,"he didn't get around to turning himself in, either.",why not?
870,the seats and windows are dirty.,don't they clean the bus every night?
871,i think they do.,you should bring some wipes with you.
872,that's a good idea.,then you can wipe your seat and window.
873,people will think i'm strange.,who cares? everyone is strange.
874,that's for sure.,don't worry about what people think.
875,why not?,"number one, it's too slow."
876,you're right. a car is faster.,"number two, it's usually late."
877,you're right. the buses are never on time.,"number three, it doesn't run 24 hours."
878,you're right. buses don't run late at night.,"number four, it's too crowded."
879,you're right. you have to stand in the aisle.,"number five, it's unsafe."
880,you're right. bad guys might rob you.,what was the problem?
881,someone cut the tires.,what tires?
882,the tires on the cars.,where were the cars?
883,they were in the student parking lot.,how many tires were cut?
884,one or two tires were cut on each car.,how many cars?
885,eleven cars.,that's terrible. i hope they catch the person.
886,it sure isn't.,i got a ticket yesterday.
887,what for?,i was crossing the street.
888,were you in a crosswalk?,"yes, but the red hand was blinking."
889,so? that's a ticket?,"yes, it's a $140 ticket."
890,that's not right!,"when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking."
891,you need to walk faster.,why do you say that?
892,the speed limit is 65.,i know that.
893,but you're doing 75.,so is everyone else.
894,but a cop might stop you.,"no, he won't. some cars are doing 85."
895,so the cop will stop those cars?,of course. he stops the fastest cars.
896,my friend got a ticket for doing 75.,your friend was unlucky.
897,how often do i have to do that?,once every two months.
898,that's a lot.,what do you mean?
899,that's six times a year!,"yes, and it takes about five minutes each time."
900,i'll try.,check your tires or you'll get a flat.
901,oh. that's not good.,"no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money."
902,and i don't have either.,i'm in a hurry.
903,don't ever be in a hurry.,it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up.
904,that's not my fault. you didn't tell me to wake you up.,"well, i meant to."
905,don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.,why not?
906,because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry.,how do you know that?
907,i read a lot.,i thought drunks caused most accidents.
908,where are we going?,into the mountains.
909,that sounds nice.,i want to show you my new car.
910,you bought a new car?,yes. i bought a cadillac.
911,a luxury car.,luxury plus speed.
912,what are we waiting for?,let me get the keys.
913,let me get my camera.,why didn't you go before we left?
914,"i did, but i have to go again.","well, hold on a little longer."
915,i think i'm going to explode.,just hold on.
916,oh! don't hit any more bumps!,we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes.
917,i hope they are fast minutes.,think about something else. think about a hamburger.
918,"i'm thinking, but i still have to go.",it's the next exit. hold on!
919,what do you mean?,the car isn't here.
920,where did you park it?,i parked it right here.
921,are you sure?,yes. i remember this big tree.
922,maybe it's the wrong tree.,"no, this is the tree."
923,did someone steal it?,i sure hope not.
924,maybe they towed it away.,i'd rather not.
925,it gets worse every year.,why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
926,the speed limit is 65!,"well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m."
927,where are all these people going?,they're all asking the same question.
928,when are they going to fix this problem?,they said they need more money.
929,they always need more money.,it'll get worse before it gets better.
930,"yes, he went through the red light.",can we call the police?
931,"no, the police don't care.",why not?
932,they have to see it happen.,they don't believe us?
933,no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen.,"so, what do we do?"
934,we don't do anything.,maybe we should honk the horn next time.
935,the driver will just honk back at us.,why don't you wash it?
936,that's what i'm going to do.,are you going to wash it yourself?
937,of course. it's not a hard job.,i'll help you.
938,"okay, i'll get a bucket.",i'll rinse the car first.
939,then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.,"after that, we can dry it with a towel."
940,then it will look like new,and you save $10.
941,paper is flying everywhere.,this wind is dangerous for drivers.
942,especially for drivers of big trucks.,the wind blows those trucks over.
943,"it blows trees over, too.",a tree fell onto my dad's car.
944,was there much damage?,my dad had to buy a new car.
945,wow! that's terrible.,never park your car under a tree.
946,"the wind will get you, or the birds will get you.",we'll stop at the next mcdonald's.
947,how far away is that?,i think we'll be there in half an hour.
948,i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.,"well, i can always pull over."
949,"no, thank you, i'll just wait.",we can kill two birds with one stone.
950,what do you mean?,"while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food."
951,don't order for me. i'm not hungry.,"i'm very hungry. i'll order for you, and then i'll eat yours."
952,look how many cars are waiting in line.,they need a left-turn arrow.
953,only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.,we'll be here forever.
954,get out of this lane.,but we need to turn left.
955,forget it. go straight.,then what?
956,then we'll just make a u-turn.,and then we can turn right at the light.
957,good idea. it will be so much quicker.,how much money do you have?
958,"$1,000.","well, that should get you something."
959,but i need something that's reliable.,you need a car with low mileage.
960,a car that was owned by a little old lady.,where have you looked?
961,i haven't looked anywhere yet.,why not?
962,because i'll never find one for such a low price.,you're right about that. keep saving your money.
963,"your driver's license and registration, please.",here you go.
964,do you know why i pulled you over?,i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.
965,you rolled through that stop sign back there.,but i stopped!
966,"no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.","well, nobody else does, so why should i?"
967,that's not the attitude of a good driver.,but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life.
968,"well, you've got one now. here. have a nice day.",what are you talking about?
969,i got a ticket downtown for $140.,were you speeding?
970,"no, i was crossing the street.",were you jaywalking?
971,"no, i was in the crosswalk.",so why did you get a ticket?
972,the officer said the red hand was blinking.,was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
973,"no, the white walk sign was blinking.",you should fight that ticket. i'll be your witness.
974,who?,two students from usc.
975,what happened?,"a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl."
976,what happened to the other student?,he landed on the hood of the car.
977,did he get off the hood?,"no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood."
978,i'll bet the car continued on its way.,of course it did. why stop after you've run over two people?
979,i hope they find them and put them in jail for life.,i got a dent in the parking lot.
980,how did you get it?,i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart.
981,those shopping carts are dangerous.,especially the metal ones.
982,i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.,"that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store."
983,did you save any money on the sale?,"yes, i did. i saved about $50."
984,that's great.,"yes, except this dent will cost about $150."
985,yes. it is a great movie.,i saw it twelve times.
986,i saw it eight times.,i have the dvd.
987,so do i.,let's go to your home.
988,we can watch my dvd.,and then we can go to my home.
989,and watch your dvd.,i always cry at the end.
990,me too. it's so sad.,i don't know any card games.
991,i'll teach you one.,okay. what will you teach me?
992,it's called poker.,is it easy to learn?
993,"yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.",okay. teach me how to play.
994,we each get five cards.,"oh, look. i have four tens."
995,"that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.","oh. sorry. okay, i don't have four tens."
996,why is that?,because i watch the other players.
997,what do you mean?,people will tell you if they have a good hand.
998,how do they do that?,"for example, a friend of mine licks his lips."
999,"when he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?","i know he has a good hand, so i don't bet."
1000,he never wins your money?,"nope, and it drives him crazy."
1001,he knows you can't read his mind. maybe he thinks you're cheating.,but i'm listening to it.
1002,"well, listen to it more quietly.",i can't wait till i grow up.
1003,what will you do?,i will play the radio as loud as i want.
1004,that's okay with me.,i will have a radio in every room of my house.
1005,remind me to never visit you.,all the radios will be on extra loud.
1006,your neighbors will hate you.,"if they don't like it, they can move."
1007,your chances are very small.,but you can't win if you don't play.
1008,ha! you can't win if you do play.,someone has to win.
1009,that's what everyone says.,it might as well be me.
1010,that's what everyone says.,you're trying to tell me something.
1011,that didn't take long.,you think i should quit playing.
1012,save your money for school.,nothing much.
1013,what about the baseball game?,it got rained out.
1014,rained out?,"yes, rained out."
1015,how could that be?,"well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm."
1016,i thought they were playing under a dome.,the dome doesn't close.
1017,why doesn't it close?,who knows? they said they'll fix it before next season.
1018,sure. here you go.,"hmm, that's not bad."
1019,there's nothing in it.,what do you mean?
1020,"i mean, it's just coffee.",i figured that.
1021,it's not too bitter for you?,"it's a little bitter, but it's okay."
1022,there's no sugar or cream in it.,"no, it's a taste you have to get used to."
1023,sort of like beer.,what's the weather like?
1024,let me step outside and see.,"it's a little chilly, right?"
1025,"yes, it is.",i'll put on my cap.
1026,"wear a jacket, too.",i wonder if i should bring my gloves.
1027,"maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.",i'll put a glove in each pocket.
1028,we'll get warmer as we walk.,"yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down."
1029,that driver is crazy.,i can't believe he hasn't crashed.
1030,how fast is he going?,they say he's going 80 miles per hour.
1031,he's going to kill someone.,look! he just hit that car.
1032,"oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets.",now he's slowing down.
1033,maybe he ran out of gas.,look! he just got out of the car and started running.
1034,i hope the police catch him.,they shouldn't even call it news.
1035,last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.,yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
1036,last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.,last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
1037,the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.,the sports guy shows us players fighting.
1038,"they always tell us ""what's next.""","they always make ""what's next"" sound exciting, but it never is."
1039,it's more like news for kids.,they should have kid reporters.
1040,computers are so cool.,i love to go online.
1041,the internet is amazing.,you can travel all over the world.
1042,i know. i went to china yesterday.,what did you do?
1043,i stood on the great wall and looked all around.,what was it like?
1044,it was like the real thing.,it was like being there?
1045,"yes, i felt like i was actually there.",they are the best musical group ever.
1046,i love all their songs.,i don't know which one i like the best.
1047,i like the ones i can sing along with.,"so do i, like ""she loves you."""
1048,"""she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!...""","""Ã‚â€¦and you know you should be glad!"""
1049,what a great song.,"how about ""let it be?"""
1050,"oh, yes! ""let it be, let it beÃ‚â€¦""","""Ã‚â€¦there will be an answer, let it be!"""
1051,i'd rather not.,why not?
1052,you know i don't like crowds.,let's go to an early movie.
1053,"okay, that won't be very crowded.",what would you like to see?
1054,"oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out.","well, i want to see ""the pursuit of happyness."""
1055,what have you heard about it?,it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
1056,"well, i hope it has a happy ending.",i like to watch people.
1057,that's your favorite thing to do?,"well, it's one of them."
1058,where do you go to watch people?,my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks.
1059,that sounds like a good spot.,we watch people walk by with their dogs.
1060,i guess you see lots of different dogs.,we don't even know what kind most of them are.
1061,"there are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.","yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet."
1062,"yes, he was on the tv news today.",every easter sunday he gives away money.
1063,is it his money?,no. movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
1064,how much money does he give away?,"this year he gave away $15,000."
1065,that's a lot of money.,he gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
1066,what about the other homeless people?,they got $1 each.
1067,people stood in line just to get one dollar?!,even though they're in black and white.
1068,a good story is more important than color.,actors didn't curse back then.
1069,and there was no violence.,people today don't like that.
1070,"no, today people like lots of action.",i like a good story.
1071,i like to see actors who are like real people.,like real people with real problems.
1072,they still make movies like that.,"yes, but they never make much money."
1073,"yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system.",it puts me to sleep.
1074,tell me about it.,a gardening show follows a knitting show.
1075,a cooking show follows a sewing show.,a travel show follows another travel show.
1076,i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!,now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies.
1077,i sure would like to see something interesting for a change.,"if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows."
1078,who wants to donate? public tv should be free.,is that a tv show?
1079,yes. it's on every afternoon.,what's so good about it?
1080,they have interesting lawsuits.,such as?
1081,"yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on ebay.",was something wrong with the phone?
1082,it works only in canada.,did the seller know that?
1083,"yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.",i hope judge judy made the seller take the phone back.
1084,"yes, but she looks like a man.",what difference does it make?
1085,female singers are supposed to be pretty.,singers are supposed to sound good.
1086,"they should look good, too.",there are lots of ugly men singers.
1087,men singers don't have to look good.,then neither do women singers.
1088,"well, i would never buy her cd.",but you would buy her cd if she was pretty?
1089,yes. i would buy all of her cds.,"yes, that will occur next month."
1090,most of them are already broadcasting in digital.,the digital signal is very clear.
1091,"oh, no, it isn't!",what do you mean?
1092,i can't get a single channel.,do you have a digital tv?
1093,of course. but i don't have cable.,"you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna."
1094,but i have rabbit ears.,rabbit ears aren't strong enough. buy a digital antenna.
1095,"oh, really?",are you interested?
1096,maybe. what is she like?,she's got a great personality.
1097,uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.,she's cute.
1098,"okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.",she weighs 98 pounds.
1099,"okay, she's not fat. so what's the problem with her?",who said there is a problem with her?
1100,the problem is she has no problemsÃ‚â€”she's too good for me!,thank you.
1101,would you have dinner with me?,i would like to.
1102,can i pick you up friday night?,what time?
1103,eight o'clock.,that sounds great.
1104,we'll go to a french restaurant.,i've never been to a french restaurant.
1105,i think you'll love the food.,i'm not going to eat any snails!
1106,thank you. so do you.,i wish my eyes were blue.
1107,what's the matter with green eyes?,"nothing, except my favorite color is blue."
1108,maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.,but what if i'm a fish in my next life?
1109,i think some fish have blue eyes.,i hope i don't come back as a fish.
1110,i hope i come back as a cat.,cats have beautiful eyes.
1111,i would love to have blue cat-eyes.,"i love you, too."
1112,i loved you the first day i saw you.,it was love at first sight?
1113,"yes, it was love at first sight.",i didn't love you at first.
1114,i know. i had to chase you for a while.,"yes, you chased me and then you caught me."
1115,now you're mine forever.,and you're mine forever.
1116,we'll grow old together.,and be happy together.
1117,have you told her?,of course not.
1118,why not?,she would laugh at me.
1119,how do you know?,because they always do.
1120,maybe she's different.,they're all the same.
1121,just ask her out to dinner.,and then what?
1122,and then she'll know that you like her.,i'm not in the mood.
1123,what's the matter?,i saw you looking at that woman.
1124,what woman?,"you know, that woman with the big boobs."
1125,i was not looking at her.,"you were, too."
1126,i'm not interested in her.,then why were you looking at her?
1127,i was looking at something else.,"oh, really? then spend tonight looking at the sofa."
1128,you must be joking.,"no, i'm serious."
1129,i don't want to date a blind woman.,a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
1130,what does it mean?,a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
1131,why would i date someone i don't even know?,to try something new and exciting.
1132,what if i don't like her?,then you don't date her again.
1133,really? who with?,a girl i met at the market.
1134,you met a girl at the supermarket?,she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
1135,what did you say to her?,"i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them."
1136,she asked you about your pineapples?,"i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine."
1137,that was nice of you.,"she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out."
1138,sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.,"yes, in fact, i did."
1139,who did you go out with?,a man i met in a coffee shop.
1140,where did you go?,we went to a nice restaurant.
1141,anywhere else?,then we went to a jazz club.
1142,that sounds like a nice date.,"yes, it was pleasant."
1143,but you won't date him again?,"no. he was nice, but there was no chemistry."
1144,what happened?,"first of all, he was half an hour late."
1145,that's not a good start.,then he didn't bother to apologize.
1146,that's rude.,then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
1147,that's dangerous.,i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
1148,what happened at the restaurant?,"we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!"
1149,i guess you can't go back to that restaurant.,why not?
1150,he's a dirty old man.,what do you mean?
1151,"he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.","well, you can't blame a man for asking."
1152,he should act his age.,but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
1153,they should find a nice hobby.,just wait until you're 50 years old.
1154,dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.,that's what you say now. wait till you're 50.
1155,sometimes.,what does she do?
1156,"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.",that was a nice thing to say.
1157,that's what i thought.,what did she say?
1158,she laughed! she didn't believe me.,that wasn't very nice of her.
1159,she said that nothing is more important to me than money.,what did you say?
1160,i told her i wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.,i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.
1161,i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.,oh. but that can be a curse.
1162,"yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.",i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
1163,did she catch you using drugs?,sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
1164,you don't need a good nose for thatÃ‚â€”cigarettes stink.,"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!"
1165,"boy, that is a good nose.",i told her she should apply for a job at customs.
1166,that sounds like fun.,where do you want to go?
1167,let me think a minute.,i feel like chinese.
1168,that sounds delicious.,i know a good chinese restaurant.
1169,how far away is it?,it's only 10 minutes from here.
1170,do we need reservations?,"oh, no. we can walk right in."
1171,let's go now. i'm hungry!,"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?"
1172,"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?",it's the slowest hamburger in town.
1173,that's because they cook it while you wait.,yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
1174,a great burger and great service.,"yes, the workers are very polite."
1175,and they're clean.,i've been coming here for years.
1176,me too.,excuse me. they just called my number.
1177,thank you.,what kind of soup was that?
1178,it was tomato soup.,that tasted so good.
1179,i put lemon and butter in it.,"the sandwich was good, too."
1180,everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.,especially on toast.
1181,"and the pickles were great, too.",tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
1182,i can't wait.,what's the matter?
1183,this steak has too much fat.,what do you want the waiter to do?
1184,bring me a better steak.,i wouldn't do that.
1185,why not?,"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it."
1186,you're crazy.,then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
1187,where do you get these crazy ideas?,i used to cook in a restaurant!
1188,but we just got here.,did you see the waiter's hands?
1189,no.,he had dirty fingernails.
1190,really?,his nails were black!
1191,that's disgusting.,and he poured water into our glasses.
1192,yuck! no water for me.,"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too."
1193,who cares? let's get out of here.,i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
1194,"well, i think we are paying for it.",no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.
1195,"it is delicious, especially with butter.",i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
1196,they probably wouldn't like that.,i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.
1197,then stop eating the bread!,"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please."
1198,"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.",that's terrible. i would never go to your restaurant.
1199,"well, the tables and chairs look okay.","okay, let's sit down."
1200,check out the silverware.,it passes inspection.
1201,here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.,"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here."
1202,you're forgetting about the bathroom.,i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
1203,you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?,"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now."
1204,"me, too. let's forget about germs and focus on food.",here he comes now.
1205,we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.,"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter."
1206,"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.",i'll go up front and talk to the manager.
1207,that's a good idea.,maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
1208,maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.,"every time we eat out, it's an adventure."
1209,"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.",we'll never go there again.
1210,"no, it's too close to the kitchen door.",how about this table?
1211,"no, it's too close to the front door.",this looks like a nice table.
1212,"no, it's too close to the salad bar.","okay, i give up."
1213,"well, there is one good table.",great. which one?
1214,that one. a group of eight just sat down at it.,what is it this time?
1215,an andy warhol drawing.,he's a famous artist.
1216,he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.,did he sign it?
1217,yes.,is it beautiful?
1218,it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!,so it's not worth much?
1219,"only about $30,000.","without the food stains, it would probably be worth more."
1220,of course.,i love baseball.
1221,so do i.,i love to eat the peanuts.
1222,i love to eat the hot dogs.,i hope we'll see a home run.
1223,i hope we'll catch a foul ball.,bring a jacket.
1224,yes. it gets a little cool at night.,bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
1225,no. i'll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.,it certainly is.
1226,you hit a white ball.,and then you chase it.
1227,and then you hit it again.,"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground."
1228,"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.",what's the point?
1229,how can it be fun?,they pay money to play this silly game!
1230,i think golfers have a mental problem.,i think they're nuts.
1231,yes. that's a good idea.,where do you want to go?
1232,we can go to the river.,or we can go to the lake.
1233,or we can go to the ocean.,let's go to the lake.
1234,yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.,we can be there in 20 minutes.
1235,i'll get our fishing rods.,i'll get the bait.
1236,we'll have fresh fish for dinner!,i like to hit the ball.
1237,i like to run around the bases.,i like to slide into the bases.
1238,yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.,i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.
1239,me too. i want to play for the yankees.,not me. i want to play for the dodgers.
1240,we have to practice every day.,i don't like practice.
1241,me neither. it's boring.,but practice makes perfect.
1242,that's a good idea.,i bought some new shoes.
1243,are they comfortable?,they're very comfortable.
1244,how much were they?,they were on sale for $80.
1245,do they help you run faster?,"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore."
1246,then they're worth every penny.,you might want to buy a pair.
1247,i'll wait until i wear this pair out.,you can say that again.
1248,but i'm worried about tiger.,why is that?
1249,because he likes to scuba dive.,what's wrong with that?
1250,it can be dangerous.,you mean he could drown.
1251,he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.,but he dives to relax.
1252,"he might relax, but it makes me nervous.","if his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind."
1253,the one that tiger won?,how did he do it?
1254,it was nothing for him.,he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
1255,he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.,i think he is from outer space.
1256,no human could possibly play golf that well.,"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot."
1257,no human can do that.,somebody should check his birth record.
1258,i bet it says he was born on mars.,there are so many great players.
1259,"yes, but who is the greatest?",i'd have to say babe ruth.
1260,most people would say that.,he changed the game.
1261,"yes, he made the home run popular.","everybody loved him, all over the nation."
1262,he helped make the yankees the best team ever.,"and ruth was a good person, too."
1263,he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.,there will never be another babe.
1264,"no, please tell me.",someone punched out someone.
1265,that's not nice.,it's worse than that.
1266,how so?,two guys got into an argument.
1267,i'll bet they were drinking.,a third guy punched one of the two guys.
1268,"i'll bet he was drinking, too.",the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
1269,that's terrible. can't people just have fun at a baseball game?,is there a game tonight?
1270,"yes, it starts at 7 p.m.",can we get tickets?
1271,"yes, but only the cheap tickets.",how much are they?
1272,they're only $5 each.,that's a good price.
1273,"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.",where are the seats?
1274,they're behind the outfield.,maybe we can catch a home run ball.
1275,what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?,it's hard if you want to do it right.
1276,you mean like tiger?,"no, like a good amateur golfer."
1277,what's so hard about golf?,there are so many things you have to do right.
1278,like what?,"like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through."
1279,yikes! who can remember all that?,you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
1280,forget it. golf sounds more like work than fun.,the home run hitter on drugs?
1281,he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.,he said he wasn't using drugs.
1282,he apologized to the fans.,the league suspended him for 50 games.
1283,that will cost him some money.,"yes, about $7 million."
1284,that will teach him a good lesson.,he probably won't use drugs anymore.
1285,but it won't stop other players from using drugs.,no. everyone always figures that they won't get caught.
1286,because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.,is that it?
1287,"also, there aren't enough police.",but there are a lot of police.
1288,there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.,can't we hire more police?
1289,no. it costs too much money.,doesn't crime cost more than police?
1290,"yes, it does.",so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
1291,"yes, it would.","yes, it is."
1292,people are friendly.,"yes, they are."
1293,the streets and sidewalks are clean.,"yes, they are."
1294,there's a real nice park nearby.,"yes, there is."
1295,i feel safe here.,there is no crime here.
1296,i wish i could move here.,"maybe you can, if someone moves out."
1297,what happened?,the man fell asleep.
1298,was he smoking?,"yes, he was smoking a cigarette."
1299,did he die?,"yes, he did. his cat died, too."
1300,that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?,the battery was dead.
1301,a good battery would have saved his life.,"he had cigarettes, but no battery."
1302,it happens all the time.,he's been in jail three times already.
1303,why did they ever let him out?,it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.
1304,why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.,i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
1305,but his latest fire killed someone.,this time they have charged him with murder.
1306,so maybe he'll go to jail forever?,i sure hope so.
1307,someone should set him on fire.,that would teach him a good lesson.
1308,why?,because it will protect you in case of an accident.
1309,but it's uncomfortable.,it's the law.
1310,it's so much trouble.,it's common sense.
1311,it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.,hold your breath till we get there.
1312,"okay, my seatbelt is on.",i'm glad you don't complain very much.
1313,i'm ready for an accident.,i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.
1314,what are you standing on?,a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
1315,are you crazy?,what's the matter?
1316,those books will slip and you'll fall.,it's only a couple of feet.
1317,"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?",i never thought about that.
1318,you'd be blind for the rest of your life!,i'll get the stepladder.
1319,yes. i called for a clean-up.,a puddle of water is very dangerous.
1320,it isn't easy to see.,but it's real easy to slip on.
1321,especially on these slick floors.,someone who slips could hurt their back.
1322,they could even crack their head open.,we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
1323,we can leave if we put an orange cone here.,"yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are."
1324, it doesn't matter. here he comes now with the mop.,we tell our students to leave the classroom.
1325,can they take their belongings?,"yes, if they do it quickly."
1326,where do the students go?,they go out to the north parking lot.
1327,what do the teachers do?,we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
1328,why do you do that?,we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
1329,"if they are all outside, then what?",then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.
1330,why? we're already late.,i have to check the stove.
1331,what's the matter?,maybe i left the burner on.
1332,"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left.",are you sure?
1333,of course i'm sure.,"well, i have to go back upstairs anyway."
1334,it's getting later every minute.,i think i left the water running.
1335,"no, you didn't. let's go! the only thing running is the clock!",what are they paying?
1336,"up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.",why are they doing this?
1337,they want to get guns off the street.,who would turn in a gun for $200?
1338,that isn't a good deal?,a good gun costs $400 or more.
1339,"well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.",i'll keep my receipt and my gun.
1340,i didn't know you had a gun.,everyone in america should have a gun.
1341,i sure am.,you should go to bed.
1342,i will as soon as i finish this article.,what are you reading?
1343,it's about crime in los angeles.,what does it say?
1344,the mayor says the crime rate is going down.,then why does everyone lock their doors?
1345,i guess they haven't read this article.,no one believes that the crime rate is going down.
1346,maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.,why is that?
1347,because of all the earthquakes and fires.,but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
1348,once in a while is once too many.,but you're right. there are a lot of fires.
1349,a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.,"still, it's safer than florida."
1350,florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.,"no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october."
1351,but most of those hurricanes are harmless.,"excuse me. hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!"
1352,did you like it?,i loved it. i want to live there.
1353,what did you like?,"the island is so green, and the water is so blue."
1354,did you go swimming?,i went to the beach every day.
1355,how was the weather?,it was hot and sunny every day.
1356,what did you do at night?,at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.
1357,people who live in hawaii are lucky.,what do you like about it?
1358,we get a free breakfast.,coffee and a roll?
1359,"no, a real breakfast.",bacon and eggs?
1360,"with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.",wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights.
1361,"and the rooms are clean, too.",do they allow pets?
1362,"no pets, no smoking.",i like that. let's stay three nights.
1363,what's the matter? this is a nice room.,"maybe the room is nice, but not the bed."
1364,what's wrong with the bed?,look at this sheet.
1365,yes?,see those stains?
1366,i sure do.,i'm not sleeping on that sheet.
1367,"well, just call the front desk. they'll give us new sheets.",i want sheets without stains on them.
1368,"from now on, let's bring our own sheets.",it leaves at 12:15.
1369,when do you have to be at the airport?,i have to be there two hours early.
1370,so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.,that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
1371,"well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.",so maybe we better leave at 8:15?
1372,"yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.",i agree.
1373,you never know what might happen on these freeways.,there's at least one huge accident every day.
1374,when are you going?,during the christmas holidays.
1375,you'd better buy your ticket now.,you must be kidding.
1376,"no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right now.",i thought i would wait until october.
1377,i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.,you're right.
1378,"well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now.",but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.
1379,cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.,so do i.
1380,"a long time ago, flying used to be okay.",now it's like riding a bus.
1381,you're jammed in with people all around you.,"half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing."
1382,you don't have any elbow room or knee room.,people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
1383,kids are crying or climbing over you.,it's a flying zoo!
1384,i wish i could afford first class seats.,doesn't everybody?
1385,good for him.,why would he do that?
1386,did he set a new record?,"yes, i think he did."
1387,"well, i guess that's why he did it.",what's the point?
1388,now he has the world record!,"but someone's going to break it, so what good is it?"
1389,"well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.",i don't think he even got paid for it.
1390,some people do it just to do it.,that sounds like fun. where do you want to go?
1391,i want to cruise to hawaii.,"that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food."
1392,i have no idea how much it will cost.,i think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
1393,"well, of course i want to go when the weather is nice.","yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms."
1394,and i want to get a big cabin with a view.,are you going to travel alone?
1395,"no, my sister and i will travel together.","well, you should go online and try to find a good deal."
1396,because of all the security?,"no, because it hurts my ears."
1397,what do you mean?,"every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much."
1398,"that's just the altitude change, i think.","whatever it is, it hurts."
1399,can't you take medicine or something for it?,"i've tried everything, but nothing works."
1400,have you tried earplugs?,"they don't work, either."
1401,"well, be glad you're not a pilot.",are you going to go anywhere?
1402,i was thinking of driving to arizona.,to the grand canyon?
1403,yes. i've never been there.,i was there when i was a kid.
1404,how did you like it?,i loved it. i still remember how amazing it was.
1405,"i'm sure i'll like it, too.",you should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
1406,no way! i don't want to fall to my death.,don't worry. only one person has ever fallen off a mule.
1407,the worst in the whole world.,the walls were so thin.
1408,all day long we heard tvs or telephones.,all night long we heard people snoring.
1409,housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.,room service brought us a cold dinner.
1410,our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.,our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
1411,they added phony charges to our bill.,how did we end up in that terrible hotel?
1412,the travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!,it's not even 10 o'clock.
1413,i'm falling asleep on the phone.,you got up real early.
1414,i had to take my friend to the airport.,why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
1415,i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.,why is that?
1416,there was a bomb threat at the airport.,only a threat?
1417,"yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.",someday the bomb is going to be for real.
1418,why did he do that?,"he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans."
1419,who invited them?,some private organization.
1420,why did they invite him?,to thank him and all the other soldiers who served in world war ii.
1421,that's very nice.,my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.
1422,that trip must have cost a lot of money. ,he said all the money came from private donations.
1423,"tell me about it, dad.",about 90 of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
1424,how long was the flight?,it only took about two hours.
1425,did you take pictures at the world war ii monument?,"oh, yes. we all took lots of pictures."
1426,then you flew back home that evening?,"yes. when we landed, tv reporters and the army band were there."
1427,that must have made you feel really special.,"oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us."
1428,"well, you all deserve it. you helped save our country.",i thought you had a job.
1429,i did.,what happened?
1430,i got laid off.,that's terrible! when did it happen?
1431,i got laid off last week.,just you?
1432,"no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too.",what are you going to do?
1433,i'm looking in the newspaper for a job.,good luck!
1434,what's to check?,are your nails clean?
1435,"yes, they are.",did you double-check your nose and teeth?
1436,"they are clean, too.",did you shine your shoes?
1437,my shoes are shined.,do your socks match?
1438,of course they match.,"no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue."
1439,yikes! thank you.,it sure is.
1440,i thought school was hard.,"me, too. i couldn't wait to graduate."
1441,"but now work is hard, too.",i agree. work is just as hard as school.
1442,sometimes i wish i was back in school.,"me, too. school was fun."
1443,and it was only 12 years.,it went by pretty fast.
1444,but work goes on forever!,we have to work for 30 years!
1445,so am i.,i had a long day.
1446,so did i.,i didn't even have lunch.
1447,neither did i.,i was busy the whole day.
1448,so was i.,i had to bring work home with me.
1449,i did too.,your day was just like mine.
1450,of course it was. we work together!,what do you do?
1451,i'm a babysitter.,is that a lot of work?
1452,babies cry all the time.,you have to change their diapers.
1453,i have to feed them.,are you looking for another job?
1454,"no, i'm looking for another family.",another family?
1455,a family with only one baby.,that's a good idea.
1456,what was your last job?,i was a painter.
1457,what happened?,i got laid off because there was no work.
1458,what else can you do?,i'm a handyman.
1459,can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?,of course.
1460,then i have a job for you in my kitchen.,it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
1461,okay. that sounds like a fair price.,i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.
1462,do you have any other skills?,"well, i know how to flip hamburgers."
1463,no one would hire you to flip hamburgers.,have you heard something that you're not telling me?
1464,what do you mean?,are there going to be layoffs at this place?
1465,i certainly hope not!,"if you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too."
1466,"oh great, we could both work at burger king.","maybe we'd get laid off there, too."
1467,"yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.",i tell my students to become a teacher.
1468,teaching is a great job.,it's the best job i've ever had.
1469,what makes it so good?,"for me, it's the students."
1470,what do you mean?,i mean i have wonderful students.
1471,that must be nice.,teaching is the best part of my whole day.
1472,you're a lucky man to have a job you love.,how long did it take?
1473,"four hours, without a break.",it's always nice to finish a job.
1474,"well, it's good and bad.",what's bad about it?
1475,"when you finish, all you do is start another job!","yes, that's right. it does get boring."
1476,"especially if it's the same work, over and over.",but that's what most people do.
1477,"yes, i guess most of us are stuck in a routine.",i wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.
1478,what makes him so bad?,he's rude and he yells a lot.
1479,that's hard to take.,i've never heard him say please or thank you.
1480,he sounds like a real jerk.,no one at work likes him.
1481,can't you report him to his supervisor?,"of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job."
1482,"yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.","i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary."
1483,you shouldn't choose money over happiness.,about what?
1484,about finding a job for me.,you don't need a job. i make enough money for both of us.
1485,that doesn't matter. i don't want to sit around.,"okay, what kind of job do you want?"
1486,i'm not sure.,"well, you should do something that you enjoy."
1487,i enjoy selling. i was born to sell.,"okay, what do you want to sell?"
1488,cigarette lighters. i'll make a fortune.,but you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!
1489,"yes, i saw it on the tv news.",they need 300 new workers.
1490,"and 4,000 people showed up.",so many people are out of work.
1491,"i still have my job, thank goodness.","so do i, but i'm worried."
1492,me too. there are no guarantees.,"if you lose your job, you can move in with me."
1493,"oh, thank you. that's very nice of you.",you would do the same for me.
1494,of course. what are friends for?,what did you do?
1495,i bought some stock.,everybody buys stock.
1496,i bought it on a hunch.,you didn't read about the company first?
1497,i didn't have to. it's been in business for 60 years.,so what's the problem?
1498,i used all my savings on this one company.,you put all your eggs into one basket.
1499,"if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing.","oh, you'll have somethingÃ‚â€”you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!"
1500,what happened to your plans?,i got a d in college chemistry.
1501,"well, a d is better than an f.",a tutor helped me get the d!
1502,"so, you didn't become a doctor.",and now i'm glad that i didn't.
1503,why's that?,a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
1504,"oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.","if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals."
1505,"yes, the smart doctors are those tv news doctorsÃ‚â€”no hospitals, no patients.",why?
1506,because you get to meet a lot of people.,you sure do.
1507,and you get a lot of exercise every day.,that's the truth.
1508,and you get to play with a lot of dogs.,"well, you're supposed to be working."
1509,"yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs.",what about the unfriendly dogs?
1510,"i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.",dogs are like peopleÃ‚â€”not all of them are friendly.
1511,to the state or the city?,"to the city, of course."
1512,why do you want to move there?,because i want to make a lot of money.
1513,there are a lot of poor people in new york.,there sure areÃ‚â€”at least a million.
1514,so how do you plan to become rich?,i will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
1515,that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.,i will keep knocking on doors.
1516,all you will get is sore knuckles.,me too.
1517,i usually eat a simple salad.,what do you put in it?
1518,"just lettuce, tomato, and celery.",that's it?
1519,i add some pepper and salt.,i always put cheese in my salads.
1520,"yes, cheese is nice.",what kind of dressing do you use?
1521,i pour lots of french dressing on top.,me too. french dressing is so delicious! who cares about calories?
1522,me too.,where does cheese come from?
1523,it comes from cows.,"so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?"
1524,"yes, we do.",what else do we get from cows?
1525,we get hamburgers and steak.,"oh, that's so delicious."
1526,we also get leather.,"we get a lot of things from cows, don't we?"
1527,yes. a cow is man's best friend.,how did you like it?
1528,i loved it!,did you get free food?
1529,i ate free cheese and meat every day.,that sounds like a great job.
1530,"whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me.",did you get fat?
1531,"no, but i did put on a few pounds.",that sounds like a dream job.
1532,"it was, until one day my manager caught me.","no more free cheese for you, huh?"
1533,what are you eating now?,i switched from pasta to potatoes.
1534,why did you do that?,pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.
1535,natural food has more vitamins.,and it's just as easy to prepare.
1536,how do you prepare the potatoes?,"i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes."
1537,that's pretty simple.,"then i add butter, salt, and pepper."
1538,can i have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?,why was that?
1539,i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.,what's the matter with that?
1540,her mom is a great cook.,"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything."
1541,it hurt her feelings.,oh.
1542,"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset.",maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
1543,i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.,it's your girlfriend's fault. she should have warned you.
1544,you're kidding.,"no, i'm serious."
1545,doesn't that get old?,"no, because i'm eating food that i like."
1546,but the same thing day after day gets old.,"well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different."
1547,do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?,"no, i hate vegetables."
1548,but you eat fruits.,"i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day."
1549,"well, there's nothing wrong with that.",what's wrong?
1550,it's not orange!,your orange isn't orange?
1551,"no, it's dark pink!",are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.
1552,"i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now.","let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink."
1553,who ever heard of such a thing?,"oh, look. here's the little sticker that was on it. it's called a pink navel."
1554,what is this world coming to?,who knows? maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.
1555,"me, too. i love them roasted and salted.",i love boiled peanuts.
1556,boiled? i never heard of that.,just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
1557,i'll have to try them sometime.,they're best when they're hot.
1558,my brother is allergic to peanuts.,that's not good.
1559,"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little.",i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
1560,he has a very strict diet.,how much have you gained?
1561,three pounds just this month.,do you know why?
1562,i think it's the ice cream.,you started eating ice cream?
1563,it was on sale.,how much did you buy?
1564,i filled up my freezer with ice cream.,"well, it won't last forever."
1565,"no, i figure i'll finish it all by next week.","then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale."
1566,of course you are. you ate everything on the table.,i don't like to eat leftovers.
1567,i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.,i like my food hot and fresh.
1568,you like to see it disappear.,i don't like it reheated.
1569,"well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.",i'm so full i'm going to burst.
1570,you should loosen your belt.,i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
1571,"well, don't stand up, please.",i didn't do anything.
1572,"oh yes, you did.",what are you talking about?
1573,you know what i'm talking about.,i don't have any idea.
1574,you know what you did.,"maybe i know, but how could you know?"
1575,because i was watching you.,"okay, i'm sorry i did it."
1576,don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!,i promise i'll never drink out of the carton again.
1577,so do i.,how much is it?
1578,i don't know. the tag is missing.,ask the clerk.
1579,i will.,"oh, look. here's another shirt just like it."
1580,does it have a price tag?,"yes, it does. it's only $20."
1581,that's a great price.,i think i'll buy both of them.
1582,you'd better try them on first.,thank you.
1583,i hope they fit.,i hope you kept the receipt.
1584,you think they won't fit?,i think i've put on some weight.
1585,you think?,maybe a pound or two.
1586,maybe four or five pounds?,my waist is bigger than it was.
1587,no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.,you are so smart!
1588,let me look at our list.,i know that we need milk.
1589,nonfat.,of course. what else?
1590,"we need cheese, bread, and ham.",what kind of cheese?
1591,swiss.,"of course, the cheese with holes in it."
1592,i never used to buy swiss cheese.,why not?
1593,i didn't want to pay for the holes.,i thought you just bought a pair.
1594,i did.,what's wrong with them so soon?
1595,"the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.",you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
1596,but that's what pockets are for.,you should carry them in a purse.
1597,"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!","well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets."
1598,i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.,try a google search online.
1599,you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.,that's a great idea.
1600,"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.",i'm going to take five wipes.
1601,what do you need five of them for?,"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce."
1602,what's the matter with the produce?,do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
1603,what do you mean?,"i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges."
1604,"well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.","yes, i did."
1605,what did you buy?,"well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual."
1606,like what?,"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents."
1607,that's a good deal.,and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
1608,another good deal.,but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
1609,i don't know how that store makes money.,"neither do i, but they're doing something right."
1610,what's the matter with yours?,it's six years old.
1611,that's pretty old.,"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity."
1612,are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?,"oh, a laptop, of course."
1613,a pc or a mac?,i haven't decided yet.
1614,more and more people are using macs.,but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.
1615,and that's not going to change anytime soon.,what happened?
1616,"i had a car problem, so i went online.",did you find a solution?
1617,"yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.","so, what's the problem?"
1618,"i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.",what are you going to do?
1619,i sent them an email asking for my money back.,have you heard from them?
1620,not yet. it's been a week.,"well, i guess that's a $20 lesson for you."
1621,which one?,any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.
1622,i think there's one on the dining room table.,i already looked there.
1623,did you look in the desk drawer?,"yes, i looked there, too."
1624,don't we have about five sharpeners?,"yes, but they seem to have legs."
1625,tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.,get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
1626,yes. that way it will stay where i put it.,how are you doing that?
1627,i started shopping at the dollar store.,that saves a lot of money.
1628,i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.,that's a good deal.
1629,"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.",just put them in the fridge.
1630,"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.",why did you do that?
1631,i mixed them together.,"if the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea."
1632,can we afford it?,they want 20 percent down.
1633,that's a lot of money.,but the house is so nice.
1634,it's in a great neighborhood.,it's close to the beach.
1635,it's close to the freeways.,it's got a big yard.
1636,"the kids love the house, too.","if we don't buy it, someone else will."
1637,you're right. let's buy it now. we can worry later.,are you sure?
1638,"we will be house rich, but cash poor.",what do you mean?
1639,our monthly payments will be too high.,we won't have any money for other things?
1640,"no, we won't have money for gas or food.",we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
1641,without the peanut butter!,that's no good!
1642,we have to find a cheaper house.,of course. we can't live without gas or peanut butter.
1643,i don't like it.,what's the matter with it?
1644,it's on the corner.,so?
1645,that means it gets twice as much traffic.,you're right.
1646,"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.",or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
1647,or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.,let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
1648,"that's perfect. the less traffic, the better.","me, too."
1649,we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.,we'd better get ready to go.
1650,it's an upstairs unit.,"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet."
1651,and it's a corner unit.,that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
1652,no pets are allowed.,perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.
1653,and there are only six units in the whole building.,where's the checkbook? i'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
1654,yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.,did he say what time?
1655,yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.,did he understand what the problem is?
1656,yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.,it shouldn't take him long to fix it.
1657,i don't even know why we need to fix it.,in case we have visitors.
1658,but they can just knock on the door.,"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too."
1659,"yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.","yes, it's beautiful."
1660,it's perfect for us and the kids.,"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard."
1661,and we can afford it!,so are we going to buy it?
1662,i'm afraid not.,"it's too far from your job, isn't it?"
1663,i can't spend four hours on the road every day.,"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat."
1664,i won't be able to play with the kids.,"no, we have to find something closer to your job."
1665,it sure is.,"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too."
1666,let's turn on the heat.,i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
1667,it should be warmer in a few minutes.,it's so nice to have a heated apartment.
1668,how did they survive in the old days?,they had fireplaces.
1669,someone had to chop the wood.,and carry it into the house.
1670,all we have to do is flip a switch.,the streets are clean and quiet.
1671,the neighbors don't party on the weekends.,people take care of their lawns.
1672,no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.,we never have to call the police about anything.
1673,our kids are completely safe.,so why are we selling our house?
1674,they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.,so we've got to sell before property values go down?
1675,yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.,they're probably getting something under the table.
1676,"yes, it was.",they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
1677,and they were expensive houses.,i feel so sorry for those people.
1678,why feel sorry for rich people?,i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
1679,"so do i, but not if they're rich.",what does that have to do with it?
1680,rich people think they're better than us.,how many rich people do you know?
1681,none.,of course they are. they're starving to death.
1682,they should stay in the woods where they belong.,there's no food in the woods.
1683,can't they eat grass?,do you think a bear is a cow?
1684,"well, i've seen them eating berries.",berries aren't in season all year round.
1685,it's too dangerous for kids and pets.,people need to cover their trash cans.
1686,the police need to shoot all the bears.,you don't solve a problem by shooting it.
1687,i voted for obama.,me too.
1688,he will be a great president.,everyone likes him.
1689,he's a good speaker.,and he's really smart.
1690,he will solve our problems.,he will end the war.
1691,the next four years will be good years.,"i'll vote for him next time, too."
1692,i think everyone will.,who are you voting for?
1693,i'm not voting for the mayor.,why not?
1694,he made promises that he didn't keep.,like what?
1695,"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.",how many did he hire?
1696,one hundred!,maybe he had a good reason.
1697,maybe he's just a liar.,"maybe i'll vote for someone else, too."
1698,only 15 percent of the voters turned out.,that is a joke.
1699,"voting is so important, but people don't bother.",many people think their vote doesn't matter.
1700,"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.",we're stuck with him for four more years.
1701,voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.,all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
1702,how easy is that?,i guess people just don't care.
1703,they'll care when they see their taxes go up.,but we have the same old problems.
1704,"well, he's made a few changes.",like what?
1705,i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.,"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court."
1706,who's paying for that?,i think we are!
1707,"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.","yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly."
1708,do any other world leaders have a basketball court?,they will. you know america always leads the way.
1709,"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.",that's 50 million people who don't love obama.
1710,obama's got four years to make everyone happy.,he's never going to make everyone happy.
1711,can you imagine being president?,everyone wants you to solve their problems.
1712,i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.,you and everybody else.
1713,i would never want to be president.,but think about all the power you'd have.
1714,i prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.,what article?
1715,it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.,only 11 percent?
1716,about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.,where does he travel to?
1717,"oh, all over the world.",but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
1718,he's visiting other cities to get ideas.,can't he just go online?
1719,the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.,"well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out."
1720,i voted for ralph nader.,who in the world is ralph nader?
1721,he's the best man for president.,why's that?
1722,he hates corporations.,"well, most corporations do think only about money."
1723,he hates democrats and republicans.,"well, they do put their party before their country."
1724,he's the only candidate that i trust.,but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!
1725,"sooner or later, voters will wake up.",why's that?
1726,what good does it do?,you get to put someone in power that you like.
1727,only if my candidate wins.,"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him."
1728,"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.",that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.
1729,"and when elected, they go their own way.",they forget who put them in power.
1730,they forget where they came from.,maybe you should run for office.
1731,what do you mean?,there were more votes than voters!
1732,but that's impossible.,officials said that it's possible.
1733,did they explain how it's possible?,no. they said there are some things you can't explain.
1734,so are they going to hold another election?,no. that will cost too much money.
1735,so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?,"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election."
1736,of course they say thatÃ‚â€”their man won!,yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
1737,"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.","only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas."
1738,"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.",but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
1739,that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.,he spoke to them and made them feel better.
1740,did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?,"no, he didn't have time to do that."
1741,"well, he's got plenty of time now!","no, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president."
1742,"yes, with the voter instructions.",how are you going to vote?
1743,"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.","i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?"
1744,"against all of them, of course.","but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons."
1745,we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!,that's true. where did that money go?
1746,our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.,they are having a good time with our money.
1747,so when are we going to stop giving them more?,"do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?"
1748,"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.",you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
1749,but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.,do you believe the tv ads?
1750,i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.,"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true."
1751,"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost.""","the title should be ""better schools at huge cost."""
1752,i can't believe that they would lie to us.,of course they lieÃ‚â€”that's what politicians do!
1753,is it something you ate?,maybe. i'm not sure.
1754,what did you have for breakfast?,"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana."
1755,maybe the milk was bad.,it didn't smell bad.
1756,maybe the banana was bad.,"no, the banana was delicious."
1757,maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.,"no, that's not the problem."
1758,maybe it will go away in a little while.,i don't know.
1759,it looks like blood.,i think my nose was bleeding.
1760,you should wet your shirt immediately.,why?
1761,because that gets the blood out of the shirt.,what's a little blood?
1762,your white shirt is ruined.,"so, i'll just buy another one."
1763,you can wear this one around the house.,next time i'll soak it immediately.
1764,why do they hurt?,i type too much.
1765,you should take a break.,i need to type to make money.
1766,but typing is causing you pain.,maybe i should see a doctor.
1767,doctors are too expensive.,he might tell me to rest for a while.
1768,he might want to cut you open.,he might say i'm okay.
1769,he might say you have bone cancer.,he thinks i have too much stress.
1770,stress causes your stomachaches?,stress causes different problems with different people.
1771,so what did he tell you to do?,he said i need to think positive.
1772,he didn't give you any medication?,i hate medication. it makes me feel different.
1773,so how do you think positive?,i think about nice things.
1774,like what?,"like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand."
1775,how did you do that?,it's a paper cut.
1776,paper can be dangerous.,"it hurts, too."
1777,paper cuts can hurt a lot.,where are the band-aids?
1778,i think they're in the medicine cabinet.,it's on the tip of my finger.
1779,a band-aid might not work.,i must not use this finger until the cut heals.
1780,it might take a day or two to heal.,"oh, yes."
1781,i can't stand cigarette smoke.,it smells so bad.
1782,one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.,smokers think they are so cool.
1783,they are so weak.,a little cigarette controls them.
1784,they look so stupid taking a puff.,and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
1785,they think it's cool.,cigarettes stink.
1786,"yes, i do.",how did you get it?
1787,my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.,have you taken anything for your cold?
1788,"no, i just blow my nose a lot.",your nose is stopped up?
1789,yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.,have you tried nose drops?
1790,"no, i don't like nose drops.",they work great.
1791,i don't care. i don't like to put drops in my nose.,sure.
1792,thank you.,you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
1793,i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.,what's wrong with looking pale?
1794,people think you might be sick.,who thinks that?
1795,i don't know.,it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
1796,i know that.,so why are you arguing with me? don't lie in the sun too long!
1797,of course you can.,i don't have enough will power.
1798,of course you do.,i wish i had never started.
1799,so does every smoker.,i've tried to quit so many times.
1800,so has everyone else.,nothing seems to work.
1801,"all it takes is will power, and you have it.",then why can't i quit?
1802,you have to believe in yourself.,what did you do?
1803,i got out of my car.,that's it?
1804,i injured my back one time just by sneezing.,you should see a doctor.
1805,my doctor said i need surgery.,so?
1806,"so, forget it.",you don't have the money?
1807,i have no insurance.,maybe a back rub would help.
1808,three packs of what?,"cigarettes, of course."
1809,how can he do that?,"when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another."
1810,he's a chain smoker.,he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
1811,that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?,"he can, but the people around him can't."
1812,how can he still be alive?,his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
1813,maybe i should start smoking.,it's such a chore.
1814,"brush, brush. spit, spit.",what did they do in the old days?
1815,they brushed with their fingers.,they also ate with their fingers!
1816,why do they call it the good old days?,maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
1817,who invented flossing?,"a dentist, i'm sure."
1818,i hate flossing more than brushing!,i can't wait till all my teeth fall out.
1819,this trail is hard to climb.,especially on a hot day like this.
1820,i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.,thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals.
1821,all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.,"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears."
1822,i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.,all you've lost is some sweat.
1823,i haven't even lost one pound of fat?,"if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day."
1824,"okay, but let's hike in town. at least there are cats and dogs to see.",pimples suck.
1825,it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.,maybe it's something in your diet.
1826,"no, i eat the same things day after day.",then maybe it's in your genes.
1827,you might be right.,do pimples run in your family?
1828,not that i've noticed.,"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air."
1829,"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.","well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop."
1830,i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.,you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
1831,you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.,everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
1832,three different people will give you three different stories.,and the government will give you a fourth story.
1833,"yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.",but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.
1834,the government says we have nothing to worry about.,then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
1835,"the government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.",i wasn't picking my nose.
1836,what were you doing?,i was scratching my nose.
1837,i think i know the difference between picking and scratching.,"okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit."
1838,use a tissue next time.,i didn't have a tissue.
1839,then wait till you find a tissue.,i couldn't wait. it was an emergency.
1840,"oh, really? maybe you should have called 911.",it wasn't that kind of emergency.
1841,"yes, it's covered with crud.",i'm going to clean it.
1842,don't use water on it!,i'll use a damp cloth.
1843,don't let water get into any of the cracks.,i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
1844,don't rub the numbers off the remote.,i will rub gently but firmly.
1845,"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials.",i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
1846,maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.,what's the matter?
1847,i was on a plane.,so?
1848,"so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.",that's no good.
1849,"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.",have you seen a doctor?
1850,i've been to two doctors.,and they couldn't fix your problem?
1851,they both said i have to live with it.,or you can stay off planes.
1852,did she get a nice job?,"she got an ""everything"" job!"
1853,what do you mean?,a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
1854,why did they do that?,a mad dog bit most of her face off.
1855,"oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?","her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down."
1856,and then will she look normal again?,i guess so.
1857,god bless modern medicine.,what's wrong with it?
1858,it aches most of the time.,what do you think it is?
1859,i don't know. i think it's old age.,"if it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?"
1860,that's a good question. maybe it's not old age.,are you right-handed?
1861,yes. all my life.,you're wearing out your right hand. stop using it so much.
1862,but i do all my writing with my right hand.,s
1863,????,???????? ??? ???? ???
